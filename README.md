# JVHS-Computer-Science
Welcome to the JVHS Comp Sci club's GitHub. This is where we keep all of our problems and the solutions to them.

We do have a few rules when it comes to uploading solutions: 

  1)Please make sure to properly describe the problem before your solution code. 
  
  2)Be a good programmer. Comment out your code. Also make descriptive and concise comments. 
  
  3)If you need help with a problem, please upload the file to the "help" branch. Admin will upload the solution to master branch after it     has been approved.
