# JVHS-Computer-Science
Welcome to the JVHS Comp Sci club's GitHub. This is where we keep all of our problems and the solutions to them.

We do have a few rules when it comes to uploading solutions: 

  1)Please make sure to properly describe the problem before your solution code. 
  
  2)Be a good programmer. Comment out your code. Also make descriptive and concise comments. 
  
  3)If you need help with a problem, please upload the file to the "help" branch. Admin will upload the solution to master branch after it     has been approved.
  
  4)Strive to write beautiful code. Beautiful code is code that is short and concise. Look at problems from different perspectives and           figure out how to problems in multiple ways. Remember, coding is a medium in which one can express his or her artistic ability.
